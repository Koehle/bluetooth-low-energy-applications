* `bluetooth-numbers <https://github.com/koenvervloesem/bluetooth-numbers>`_: I created this Python package with a wide setof numbers related to Bluetooth, so Python projects can easily use these numbers. The goal of this project is to provide a shared resource so various Python projects that deal with Bluetooth don't have to replicate this effort by rolling their own database and keeping it updated.

* `HumBLE Explorer <https://github.com/koenvervloesem/humble-explorer>`_: I created this Python project as a cross-platform, command-line and human-friendly Bluetooth Low Energy scanner. It's based on Bleak and the TUI framework Textual.
